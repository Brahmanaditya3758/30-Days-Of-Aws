Welcome to Day 1 of your 30 Days of AWS Journey. Whether you're a student, DevOps aspirant, developer, or cloud enthusiast, this series will help you understand AWS from the ground up.

## Day 1 Agenda:

* What is AWS?
    
* What is Cloud Computing?
    
* What is the Public Cloud?
    
* How to Create an AWS Account?
    
* Understanding the 0 to 0 Formula.
    
* BioBasic Cloud Formula for Beginners.
    
* Console Overview.
    

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides scalable, reliable, and low-cost infrastructure for developers, startups, enterprises, and public sector organizations.

### Key Concepts:

* Launched in 2006 by Amazon.
    
* Offers computing power, storage, networking, AI/ML, security, IoT, and more.
    
* Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
    
* Supports global deployment with 32+ regions and 100+ availability zones (as of 2025).
    

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Types of Cloud:

* **Public Cloud:** Services delivered over the internet and shared across organizations.
    
* **Private Cloud:** Services maintained on a private network.
    
* **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds.
    

## What is a Public Cloud?

A public cloud is a third-party cloud service that offers infrastructure and resources (like AWS, Azure, GCP) to customers via the internet. You don’t own the hardware; you use it on-demand.

### Advantages:

* No upfront cost.
    
* Highly scalable.
    
* Global access.
    
* Managed by providers.
    

***AWS is a leading public cloud provider.***

## How to Create an AWS Account?

Setting up your AWS account is the first hands-on step in your cloud journey.

### Steps:

1. Go to aws.amazon.com
    
2. Click on Create an AWS Account.
    
3. Enter your email, password, and account name.
    
4. Enter billing details (a credit/debit card is required for verification).
    
5. Choose the Free Tier plan.
    
6. Complete identity verification (OTP/email).
    
7. Log in to AWS Management Console
    

You get 12 months of Free Tier access (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, and more) upon sign-up.

## What is the "0 to 0" Formula?

The 0 to 0 Formula is a beginner’s mindset strategy:

“Start from 0 knowledge, build 0 infrastructure manually, then automate to reach 100% automation.”

It emphasizes:

* Understanding from basics.
    
* Creating minimal setup (like EC2, S3) manually.
    
* Learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Terraform/CloudFormation later.
    

## BioBasic Formula for AWS Beginners

This is a simplified version of what you need to get started:

| Step | Topic | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Create an AWS account | AWS Console |
| 2 | Understand public cloud | AWS Docs |
| 3 | Learn Free Tier Limits | Free Tier Page |
| 4 | Explore Console UI | EC2, S3 |
| 5 | Plan next 30 days | Notion/Markdown |

Think of Day 1 as learning the environment, not diving into heavy deployments.

## Sample Console Code (Using AWS CLI – to be set up later)

```bash
# Check AWS CLI version
aws --version
```

we’ll install AWS CLI and configure credentials in upcoming days. Stay tuned!

## What's Next?

On Day 2, we’ll dive into IAM (Identity and Access Management) – the security backbone of AWS. You’ll create users, roles, and understand permissions.

# 🌩️ 30 Days of AWS Journey 🚀  
Welcome to my **30 Days of AWS Learning Journey**, inspired by **Abhishek Veeramalla's AWS playlist**. This repository documents everything I’ve learned — from the fundamentals of cloud computing to hands-on AWS services — over a dedicated 30-day learning sprint.  

Whether you're a beginner stepping into the cloud ecosystem or preparing for AWS certifications like **AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01)** or **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)**, this repo will act as a solid roadmap and knowledge base.
